# Introduction #

Small project to play around with ClassLoaders.
I want to know more about this subject so...

Started with copying the URLClassLoader and now it's time to play...


# Trials #

I'm making the classes as I go by calling them FirstTry / SeccondTry / etc.
These will all have a main with a specific test and posibly a specific setup.

Always read the Class JavaDoc to see what has to be done to get it to work.

## First ##

If you also want to play with it then you will have to change this text
(file:///Users/ivonet/dev/Classloader/ClassesNotOnClassPath/)
in the Main class to the location you cloned the reposity...

first compile the ClassNotOnClassPath by opening a console in that folder
and performing the javac command:

$ javac ivonet/*.java
